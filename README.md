## Introduction
Fine-grained categorization is an essential field in classification, a subfield of object recognition that aims to differentiate subordinate classes. Fine-grained image classification concentrates on distinguishing between similar, hard-to-differentiate types or species, for example, flowers, birds, or specific animals such as dogs or cats, and identifying airplane makes or models. An important step towards fine-grained classification is the acquisition of datasets and baselines; hence, we propose a holistic system and two novel datasets, including reef fish and butterflies, for fine-grained classification. The butterflies and fish can be imaged at various locations in the image plane; thus, causing image variations due to translation, rotation, and deformation in multiple directions can induce variations, and depending on the image acquisition deviceâ€™s position, scales can be different. We evaluate the traditional algorithms based on quantized rotation and scale-invariant local image features and the convolutional neural networks (CNN) using their pre-trained models to extract features. The comprehensive evaluation shows that the CNN features calculated using the pre-trained models outperform the rest of the image representations. The proposed system can prove instrumental for various purposes, such as education, conservation, and scientific research.
